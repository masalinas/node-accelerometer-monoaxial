# node accelerometer javascript

A proof of concept to demostrate any measure captured from a accelerometer attached to a raspberry pi 3 and transport this information throw mqtt protocol to a hub server thats centralize this information using a mqtt message broker like mosca and message router like node-red to parse and manage. In this case we will use a node-red flow on the raspberry 3 and not python service to capture the accelerometer measures.

# Infraestructure Techonologies on device

- [node-red-contrib-gpio](https://github.com/monteslu/node-red-contrib-gpio): A set of node-red nodes for connecting to johnny-five IO Plugins.
- [raspi-io](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io): An IO plugin for Johnny-Five that provides support for the Raspberry Pi.

# Frontend Techonologies on server

- [node-red-contrib-graphs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-graphs): A Node-RED graphing package.

# Installation:

Install GPIO Node-red packages on raspberry-pi 3 device:

- Stop node-red if is still running
  ```
  node-red-stop
  ```
- Start a root user from pi user:
  ```
  sudo su -
  ```
  
- Modifiy the start user of the node-red service and set root
  ```
  sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/nodered.service 
  ```  

- Start node-red, this will create a .node-red appplication directory to configure the new node red instance from root account
  ```
  node-red-start
  node-red-stop
  ```  

- Install in this last directory the new node packages to access the raspberry pi GPIO from nodejs
  ```
  cd .node-red
  npm install node-red-contrib-gpio
  npm install raspi-io
  ```  
  
- Exit the root account and restart node-red. Now the node-red instance start from root account, so the application directory of the node-red will be /roo/.node-red where we had installed all GPIO packages. This new nodes will used in our future flows to manage this pins of the raspberry pi.

  ```
  exit
  node-red-start
  ``` 
- Access Node-Red raspberry pi Web designer

```

- Copy and import this flow from node-red import clipboard to crete the raspberry pi flow
```
